    In the dawn of youth, a flame ignites, Ambition courses through eager
    nights. With dreams ablaze, and hopes set high, The world's vast canvas
    unfolds, oh, so nigh.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like a river rushing with fervent zeal, Unyielding, restless, an unruly
    appeal. Inexperienced, yet so bold and bright, Youth's ambition propels with
    fearless might.
  </p>
  <p>
    But as the years slip by, like grains of sand, The fire in their hearts
    begins to dim, unplanned. Responsibilities weigh heavy on their fragile
    wings, And the spark of dreams becomes a flicker, it sings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Life's trials and battles, their fierce combat, Slowly chip away, leaving
    scars and that. The thirst for greatness starts to wither, As reality's
    grasp tightens and pulls them hither.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hands of time, they twist and turn, As youthful ambitions slowly
    adjourn. Passion turns into complacency, a melancholy tune, And the dreams
    of the past, they fade out too soon.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, let us not mourn the loss of that fire, For youth's ambition, it never
    truly tires. Instead, let it serve as a beacon, a guide, To reignite our
    spirits, let them soar with pride.
  </p>
  <p>
    For even as the flames of youth decline, The embers of ambition still glow,
    sublime. With each passing day and lessons learned, Wiser, stronger, our
    restless souls return.
  </p>
  <p>
    So let us cherish the fire, once in our keep, And let it stir again, rousing
    from its sleep. For the ambition of youth, it may ebb and dry, But in our
    hearts, its essence shall never truly die.
